!!! warning "Switching to IoTaaP OS"
    Please be aware that we have introduced IoTaaP OS from 2021-01-29, and some of the examples here might not be up to date yet to match new features and amazing updates that we have been working on. If you notice some issue, please feel free to contact us on our e-mail (contact@iotaap.io) 
    Also, for any new project we recommend using IoTaaP OS, although deprecated libraries such as IoTaaP HAPI and IoTaaP Core will still be available.
    [**IoTaaP OS is on GitHub**](https://github.com/iotaap/iotaap-os)
