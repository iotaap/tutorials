!!! info "IoTaaP Cloud 2.0"
    Please note that from 31st of January 2021 we have implemented IoTaaP Cloud 2.0 version that supports "remote flash trigger" feature, 
    so you do not have to wait until your device detects new firmware version. In order to trigger update, you have to be connected
    to the same MQTTS server as your device, and click **Flash** button in your console. Same procedure is applicable for Group OTA Updates,
    where all devices in the group will detect the update trigger.
